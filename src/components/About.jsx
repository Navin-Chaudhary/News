              When former President Donald J. Trump challenged Vice President
              Kamala Harris's racial identity at a public forum on Wednesday —
              and again on social media the next day — that was the message at
              the core of his remarks.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-3 text-2xl">
              It is a tactic that has long been part of the underside of
              American politics: presenting an opponent as somehow “other” or
              “not one of us” — someone who cannot be trusted or truly known.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-3 text-2xl">
              But while this has been a recurrent theme in American campaigns
              for at least a century, Mr. Trump has taken it to a new level,
              historians and analysts said. What has often been a subtext or a
              whisper campaign driven by surrogates is, in Mr. Trump's hands, a
              central message of his campaign — projected on screens at a rally,
              promoted on social media and reinforced by his running mate.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 text-2xl">
              Mr. Trump has personally led the effort, explicitly falsifying the
              biography of his opponent and invoking race and gender in ways no
              modern major-party leader has done before. Even as a noncandidate
              in the 2008 election, he deployed such tactics against Barack
              Obama, demanding to see Mr. Obama's birth certificate and claiming
              that Mr. Obama — who went on to be the nation's first Black
              president and was born in Hawaii — was not born in this country.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-3 text-2xl">
              “Whenever the United States is poised to break a political glass
              ceiling, we see an intensification of othering in our politics,”
              said Timothy Naftali, a presidential historian at the School of
              International and Public Affairs at Columbia University. “What
              makes Trump a singularly poisonous political player is that the
              top of the ticket is overtly engaging in othering against his
              political opponent.”
            </p>
            <p className="mt-3 text-2xl">
              Over decades, the tactic of othering has been wielded against
              candidates with various backgrounds, characteristics and traits,
              among them race, ethnicity, gender, economic class and religion —
              all in the service of making them seem alien to voters. And it has
              often been effective. In 1928, Republican opponents seized on the
              fact that Al Smith, the Democratic candidate for president, was a
              Roman Catholic, suggesting that he would therefore be beholden to
              the Pope.

            <p className="mt-4 text-2xl">
              And it has long been a strain of politics in New York City, where
              Mr. Trump spent many of the formative years of his life. In 1989,
              Rudolph Giuliani, who went on to become a close ally of Mr. Trump,
              ran against Mayor David N. Dinkins, who was Black. One of Mr.
              Giuliani's top campaign surrogates, the comedian Jackie Mason,
              described Mr. Dinkins with a pejorative term used against Black
              people.

            <p className="mt-3 text-2xl">
              In the case of Ms. Harris, Mr. Trump for weeks had mispronounced
              Ms. Harris's first name, Kamala, which is a common name in India,
              and he made fun of her laugh. On Wednesday, during an interview at
              the National Association of Black Journalists convention, he said
              he had only recently realized that she identified as Black,
              asserting — falsely — that she had abruptly changed her identity.

              Mr. Obama was elected president, despite Mr. Trump's attempt to
              question his citizenship. “I think it will work less,” said Howard
              Wolfson, a former senior adviser to Hillary Clinton, a Democrat,
              who lost the presidential election to Mr. Trump in 2016. “The
              country is different. But given the politics he grew up in, it's
              not surprising that it's Trump's first instinct.”

              Eight years later, Mr. Obama's campaign set out to portray Mitt
              Romney, his Republican challenger, as an elite business executive
              whose company thrived at the expense of its employees. One
              advertisement, presenting Mr. Romney as a mysterious millionaire,
              questioned why he would not release his tax returns. “What is Mr.
              Romney hiding?” it asked.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-3 text-2xl">
              “It would show that on the millions of dollars in income he enjoys
              each year, Mitt Romney pays a lower tax rate than teachers,
              firefighters, police officers or other middle-class wage earners,”
              said Melanie Roussell, the press secretary of the Democratic
              National Committee, which produced the advertisement.

              Candidates from both parties often try to keep a distance from
              this kind of tactic because it is polarizing and risks a backlash.
              In 2008, John McCain, the Republican candidate running against Mr.
              Obama, distanced himself from the birtherism claims about Mr.
              Obama's nationality that percolated among voters across the
              country.

              “I can't trust Obama,” a woman said to Mr. McCain at a rally in
              Lakeville, Minn., a month before Election Day in 2008. “He's an
              Arab.” Mr. McCain shook his head. “No ma'am,” he said. “He's a
              decent family man, citizen, that I just happen to have
              disagreements with on fundamental issues that is what this
              campaign is all about.”

              Dr. Naftali, the presidential historian, said he had come across
              evidence of politicians resorting to this kind of tactic since the
              time of Abraham Lincoln: Some of Mr. Lincoln's opponents started a
              whispering campaign that he had Black ancestors.

            <p className="text-2xl mt-3">
              But it is fair to say that no presidential nominee in the nation's
              history has embraced this tactic so frontally and exuberantly as
              Mr. Trump has. He turned up the volume on these strategies as his
              campaign witnessed the enthusiastic response to the arrival of Ms.
              Harris, at least among Democrats.
